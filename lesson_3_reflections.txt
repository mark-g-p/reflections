When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It's useful when you use more than one computer or work with others. That way
    it's easier to collaborate. Also, you don't have to worry about problems with
    local storage.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Some changes to remote repository may introduce bugs which previous
    versions lack. There is also a possibility that there are conflict between
    local and remote repositories which need to be resolved manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are like clones but on GitHub servers. They keep information about 
    original repository which was cloned. Branches are parts of repository 
    where clone copies whole repository. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    That way you are capable of working with your code, without problems of
    having conflicts when you colaborate with another person. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be a hassle to send all those files and compare the differences 
    between them without Git. But people used different version control earlier,
    right?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When i introduce code which could potentially create problems with master branch, especially when different person is also working on that code. Doing it directly would be good only for solo projects.
